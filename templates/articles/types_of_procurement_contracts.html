<h2>Types of Procurement Contracts</h2>
<p>As a project manager I wanted to know more about the different types of procurement contracts that are used in project management.
  Some of the things that I learned was that when working as a project manager for different companies, there will be times when you
  have to sell what your company makes or choose to buy from another company. The equipment or necessities that are being bought and
  sold aid in keeping the company up and running. When buying and selling from other companies there has to be a procurement contract
  created which kind of is a way to keep everyone in line where they do not default on the promises that are made. The contract that
  is created between all of the parties involved cannot be broken if it is then the companies take the risk of having to owe money or
  to go to court to get the issues resolved. So, it is very important to have a procurement contract. There are different types of
  procurement contracts that can be used for different companies which are fixed priced or lump sum, cost reimbursable, and time and material.

</p>
<h2>Fixed Price or Lump Sum Contracts</h2>
<p>One of the types of procurement contracts is called a fixed price and lump sum, which is where the price for the equipment that
  you are going to buy is already set and will not change. Sometimes the people that your company is trying to buy from will increase
  the price of their products to make a profit off of what they are selling so that they do not take a loss in money.
  If a project manager has a good relationship with a company or have a specific need for a product all the time, then you would want a
  firm-fixed-price contract (FFP) which means that the price stays the same regardless of any type of changes to the economy whether
  that is prices go up or down. So, in a FFP contract the buyer will try to motivate the company to want to get the project done with
  no hiccups so they will give a fixed-price incentive fee (FPIF) which gives them more money if they complete the project in a timely
  manner and they produce good quality products. Another type of fixed contract is the fixed-price with economic price adjustment
  (FP-EPA) which is where if the products in the economy change then everything will change to whatever it is but not exceed the amount
  of money that both sides have agreed upon.

</p>

<h2>Cost Reimbursable Contracts</h2>
<p>A cost-reimbursable contract is where there is not a set price for the products that the company is going to buy. So basically,
  whatever the cost is, at the end of the project the buyer will have to pay for everything that was needed. There are three types
  of cost-reimbursable contracts that can be used which are cost plus incentive fee (CPIF), cost plus fixed fee (CPFF), cost plus
  award fee (CPAF), cost plus percentage of cost (CPPC). Cost plus incentive fee (CPIF) is where the buyer pays for everything that
  is needed but if the supplier can get it to where it is cheaper than what is expected then they will receive more money. Cost plus
  fixed fee (CPFF) is where the seller is paid money for what the project requires and is paid extra money as a payment. Another fee
  that is part of the cost reimbursable contracts is cost plus award fee where the seller is given an award or extra money for doing
  a good job and meeting all of the requirements for the project. Cost plus percentage of cost (CPPC) is where the seller gets a
  percentage of what everything cost plus the cost of what it was for the total project.

</p>
<h2>Time and Material Contracts</h2>
<p>Time and material contracts (T&M) are a combination of fixed price and cost reimbursable contracts. Time and material contracts are
  where the buyer has to pay the seller for the time that it takes to complete the project and the materials that were used for the project.
  T&M contracts are usually more specific because everything has to be tracked down to the hours that were spent on the project and amount
  of money that was spent. T&M is usually used when the information for the project is unknown which is why everything must be fully
  documented. Sometimes when working with a company as a project manager you might not know if they will produce a good quality product,
  which is why it is good to have a termination clause. A termination clause is where the company can cancel the contract at any given
  moment, especially if the company cannot meet the requirements of the project in the time that they would like for the project to be
  completed. There is another type of contract called unit pricing which is where the buyer has to pay for a product by the number of
  units that are supplied. If a company orders more products or in bulk, then the price would not be as expensive they would be able to
  get a discount on the product because they bought more.
