<p>In project management, there are many ways to approach quality control. Depending on how you choose to develop your project will determine what approach you take to quality control. When using Agile, teams should take an inside-out approach to quality assurance, with a focus on the development team. It is essential that the development team has skilled workers who are motivated to create a quality product since they are so heavily involved in the process. The project manager and project master should serve to assist and manage the development team.</p>
<p>The methodology of Agile, which leaves most of the work for the development team, promotes and incentivizes the workers to put out a quality product. Since there are no pre-defined project requirements, workers have the freedom to innovate. Frequent product testing, a unique feature of Agile, forces developers to create a quality product every single time to meet standards. As well, your Agile development team should have the patience and motivation given the extensive timelines that come with Agile project development.</p>
<p>Agile tends to stray away from the norm of project management methodologies, as it doesn't exactly adhere to any strict project requirements. Agile's lack of clearly defined project requirements leaves the development team often in charge of the bulk of the work and design. Since the Agile Scrum Team is almost exclusively developing the product, it makes the most sense to have them determine the project standards for quality. Generally, the project manager is in charge of ensuring the project is meeting quality control standards. However, the project manager's role in an Agile team is not very involved with the development work. The Scrum Team's heavy involvement in the development work makes it essential that they set quality standards for themselves as they work on the project.</p>
<p>Agile involves a constant development of changes to fit the customer's needs, but quality control should remain a constant. The expectations and requirements may change along the development, but your standard of quality should remain constant. Given the extensive timelines associated with Agile development projects, clients will be expecting a much higher level of quality for the end product. Since the standards for quality are almost always the highest with Agile, the development team needs to meet those standards and keep the client updated on the quality levels for each feature along the way.</p>

<h1>Tools Used in Agile Teams for Quality Control</h1>
<p>Test-driven development is often used by Agile teams as a function of quality control. It makes sense to me that a team would first develop a feature and then test it afterward; however, it often makes more sense to take a test-first approach to the development of features. By creating tests for a product first, it will help you map out what the development process may look like. As well, it is a way to set a quality standard for developers to meet. In different project methodologies, testing is usually done at the end of the project. Although these tests can be made before the development, it is much harder to test first for an entire project implementation.</p>
<p>One of the more essential tools used by the Agile team is Pair Programming. Pair programming is simply coding done by two developers on the same computer. The graphic below displays Pair Programming in action and compares it to a driving instructor. Similar to a driving instructor, one of the developers does the physical coding, while the other simply oversees the process as a coach. Splitting up programming work across the entire team may prove to be the most efficient way to develop a project, but may sacrifice the quality of the project. Agile methodology doesn't maintain a strict timeline, so it is important to maintain a high standard for the end product. The person in charge of overseeing the programmer is acting as a quality control manager. With Agile the quality control works within the development team, instead of from the project manager. </p>

<p>Acceptance Criteria and Definition of Done(DoD) are two things that are important to define in an Agile team. Scrum Alliance defines Acceptance criteria as “the conditions that must be satisfied for a product, user story, or increment of work to be accepted.” In essence, your acceptance criteria are the standards that must be met for a feature. Definition of Done on the other hand is exactly what it sounds like, the definition of what is considered to be a completed feature. Although it may seem repetitive to define both the Acceptance Criteria and the Definition of Done, they both are necessary for different reasons. An Agile team's Definition of Done is something that should be defined at the start of a project as a standard that applies to the entire development process. The graphic below displays an example of a potential definition of done, which references all aspects that should be completed before any feature is considered complete. A Definition of Done should be complex and cover all areas of completeness. Acceptance Criteria on the other hand should be defined for each feature at the start of the sprint. Acceptance Criteria is simply another way of referring to the requirements needed for each feature. Both the Acceptance Criteria and the Definition of Done need to be satisfied before a feature can be considered complete.</p>

<p>There are many other small things that contribute to assuring a project meets or exceeds its quality standards. By making source code collectively owned by all team members, you can assure that all members can easily view the code and are able to critique it. As well, code should be written in a consistent format throughout all team members. There should be a portion of the acceptance criteria that mentions the standard for coding style/formatting, to improve readability and make code easier to understand.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>The appropriate approach to quality control will be different for each project management methodology. It is important to choose the best-suited management style for the project, given the skillsets of the team members, the project manager, and the project master; doing so will influence the approach you need to take to have success in assuring quality standards are met. Specifically with Agile, your team should have an extensive skillset and be motivated to create a high-quality product. As a project manager, making the correct decisions is essential to the success of your team.</p>
