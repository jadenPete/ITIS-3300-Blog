        <p>Project managers often face challenges with managing the resources and expenses associated with a project. Throughout this blog post, I will explore an essential element of resource and expense management, project procurement planning. In the context of project management, procurement planning involves the sourcing, purchasing, and managing of resources. </p>
        <p>Procurement planning from an initial glance may seem as if it should function as an afterthought in the development of a project. However, you will come to realize that procurement planning is one of the make-or-break parts of most projects. When sourcing resources for a project, many things can go wrong that may prove costly to the development of the project. If project procurements are not properly managed, that project is bound to fail.</p>

        <h1>Approaching Procurement Planning</h1>
        <p>Agile’s main distinction from traditional methodologies is iterative planning cycles. Traditional procurement planning generally involves a detailed plan created at the start of a project, that is meant to remain constant throughout the development. However, an Agile approach recognizes the uncertainty that comes with complex projects and implements short and iterative planning cycles. This allows teams to adapt their planning strategies based on changing project needs, and stakeholder feedback. Given the distinctions that Agile has from traditional methodologies, it should be clear that Agile procurement planning strategies should also take this distinct, iterative approach.</p>
        <p>When it comes to procurement planning in Agile teams, project managers must work with the mindset of leaving room open for change. Whether it is leaving room in the budget, shortening the length of supplier contracts, or trying to foster collaborative relations with suppliers, the mindset of leaving all doors open to change is key. The goal of this all is to enable quick adjustments in response to changing project circumstances. Creating an environment where your team can thrive off of adaptability starts in the hands of the project manager.</p>

        <h1>Importance of Procurement Planning</h1>
        <p>In the development of any project, the physical development process will usually prove to be the most simple. The largest issues will generally arise from the procurement process, as budgets or resources may become compromised. Maintaining good relationships with suppliers and other contractors is essential to having a sense of control over project procurement. It is essential to build these relationships with vendors, as it increases flexibility and allows for project scopes to be more sporadic.</p>
        <h1>Face-to-face Meetings</h1>
        <p>Many project management methodologies may undervalue the importance of quality communication. By putting more emphasis on communication, you may at times need to spend more time on project development. However, when working on complex projects, miscommunication can be an often occurrence. Miscommunication can leave you wasting more time than that which would have been spent on face-to-face meetings in the first place.</p>

        <p>As remote work is increasingly becoming prevalent, a reliable virtual collaboration tool is essential. Zoom allows for video conferencing and screen-sharing, making it a valuable tool for agile procurement planning. Procurement teams can conduct virtual meetings, negotiate with suppliers, and review contracts in real-time, allowing for a collaborative connection even when team members aren’t able to meet in person.</p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>Although procurement planning may seem like a daunting task, by sticking to the agile mindset of collaboration and assuring quality, you can assure that adequate connections are made with suppliers, vendors, and even workers. It is not the act of finding the correct supplier, but rather making connections with suppliers to allow for project adaptations to occur later on in the project development process.</p>
