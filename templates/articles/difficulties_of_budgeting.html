<h1>Difficulties of Agile Cost Management Planning</h1>
<p>The process of planning and developing a project can last months or even years. Even if you come out with a perfectly developed product with little to no errors along the way, the project could still be considered a failure, if it goes over budget. Katie Shelvin from “toptal.com” claims that, “Recent research shows projects are mostly or always delivered on budget at only 43% of organizations.” The graph below represents these statistics by category of frequency of budget success. Although there are many organizations that consistently stay on budget for most projects, the percentage of organizations that don’t usually stay on budget is very high. This goes to show how difficult cost management planning can be, although it is not impossible. There are many strategies and tools that can be used to increase your chances of staying under budget. Because at the end of the day, one of the main goals of every project is to stay under budget.</p>

<p>Agile methodology tends to complicate cost management planning. Adaptability is a unique feature that Agile provides for project managers, but adaptability and cost management are two things that don’t go great together. While project scope is something that you should want to be flexible, a project’s budget is the opposite of that. Making constant changes to project scope forces the budget to also change. Ideally, your project budget shouldn’t ever be increased, as it would decrease profit margins. </p>

<h1>Predictive vs Agile Cost Management Planning</h1>
<p>Predictive cost management is a methodology of budgeting that focuses more on the long term. By creating a more strict budget for the entire project, the client can better expect the costs of the project and the timeline of the project. However, if the project approaches too many problems with the implementation of the project scope, it may end up having to abandon or restart the project entirely. The success rate of this methodology may be lower, but a client can better predict budgeting. Given the unpredictable nature of Agile budgeting and time management, it is essential to ensure that the client is constantly updated on any changes made.</p>

<h1>Effectively Creating a Cost Management Plan</h1>
<p>Unlike other project management methodologies, Agile deals with cost management planning in a different fashion. Instead of planning a strict long-term project budget, budgeting might be done for each sprint or feature implementation. Although a long-term budget should be considered for a projection, it is difficult to predict the long-term budget. With Agile methodology, long-term goals aren’t generally envisioned or considered. Instead, it focuses on completing features one at a time and building off of each additional feature. </p>
<p>To effectively create a cost management plan at the start of each sprint, the scrum team must make sure they do not underestimate the budget. The client will be providing the project budget investment, but, the scrum team should be in charge of presenting the calculated budget. A client will never set their budget higher than their estimated long-term return on investment; so, it is essential that you start with a lower expected budget, as it leaves more room for unexpected costs. Certain parts of a project budget can be determined from the start but it is nearly impossible to accurately calculate a project-long budget.</p>
<p>The scrum team consists of a project owner, a scrum master, and a development team. Although all members of the scrum team should be involved in the cost management planning process, the project owner should be responsible for making the final call on budget. The project owner/manager is expected to ensure that every step of the project is effectively completed with the minimum resources needed.</p>
<p>Although the focus may be on budgeting project resources, time is also something that must be budgeted by the project manager. A client will likely require a project to be fully completed and tested within a certain time window. Given the nature of Agile methodology in project management, time windows often will be extended or even shortened. So, whether it’s budgeting costs or time for the project, the project manager will play an essential role. The project manager can really make or break a project.</p>

<h1>Tools for Budgeting with Agile</h1>
<p>Affinity Grouping is an effective exercise often used in Agile project management. First, the scrum team will write all of the project tasks onto notecards. After the notecards are made, team members will take turns placing the notecards onto a board one after another. Notecards are placed around the previously placed notecard based on the difficulty of the task. Tasks that are more difficult get placed to the right, less difficult to the left, and equally difficult tasks go under. Once this exercise is completed, the team members can visualize and determine the difficulties of each task in comparison to the rest. The exercise is so effective because it both gets input from the entire team and compares the difficulty of each task to the rest.</p>
<p>Another tool used for Agile cost management planning is a burndown chart. It is used to visualize the contrast between the time budgeted for tasks and the actual time that was taken for each task. By visualizing the contrast between the actual and predicted, you can readjust for future time budgeting. As a project manager, you should want the predicted task length to be as close to the actual task length as possible. Generally, if you are spending less time than predicted on tasks, that is a good thing; however, as a project manager, you should always be looking to minimize the cost and time budget for each task if possible. An important thing to remember as a project manager is that your client stays updated on the timeline and budgeting. So, I would recommend that you offer the client access to the team’s burndown chart.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Agile is an entirely complex methodology for project management. The fast pace of changes and fluidity is what makes Agile methodology so successful, but also so difficult to execute. When working with a team of skilled and motivated workers, this methodology can prove to be the most efficient for complex projects.</p>
