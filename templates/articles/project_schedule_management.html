<h1>Agile Techniques for Effective Schedule Management Planning</h1>

<p>When working in a company many project managers struggle with meeting the deadlines that have been set by their superiors.
  Some of the project managers just do not know how to manage their time. Sometimes as a project manager you can say that we
  will have this task completed by this date. But it does not get done because a computer crashed and now your team cannot
  work, or the team may have to buy another one so that they can work to get the job done. So, there may be problems that
  might occur that the project manager or the team did not account for. Sometimes as a project manager you might just want to
  go with the flow which can cause problems because everything was not planned. If the project is not completed, then it could
  end up costing the company more money. In order to prevent the project from costing more money it is best to have a schedule
  management plan. If there is a plan it helps everything to go better.</p>

  <p>As a project manager you have to work with different people who all come from different walks of life. You have to learn how to
  interact with different people in order to get the job done. The more you communicate with your team members, the more you will
  learn to understand what they are best at. If you are able to determine what jobs your team members are best at then you can
  decide on what parts of the project, you would like them to work on by knowing their strengths and weaknesses. The team’s strengths
  and weaknesses assist you to be a better project manager.

<h1>What is Project Schedule Planning?</h1>
<p>Project schedule management is important to a company because it helps the project management team to meet the requirements of a
  project in a timely manner. Schedule planning also helps to keep the project management team on schedule. When schedule planning
  is done right then it leaves less stress on the project management team because the team knows how much money is needed, where the
  money will be allocated to, when the project will be completed, and allows them the ability to easily make changes. Project scheduling
  allows the team to know when to start on a particular part of a project and when it needs to be completed by. Schedule planning also
  allows the team to know what parts of the project need to be completed in order to get to another part of the project. In order for
  project schedule planning to go smoothly there are some steps that need to be done which are define project activities, sequence activities,
  estimate how long the project will take, develop the project schedule, resource allocation, monitor and control, adjustments, and replanning
  in order for a project to be successful.

<h1>What are Some Techniques for a Better Agile Schedule Planning?</h1>
<p>When a project manager initially gets an assignment of a project the project manager should always meet with their team.
  The meetings help the project manager to get the team’s input which aids the project in running smoothly.
  If everyone is constantly in communication with each other then the team is able to think about all of the possibilities
  of what could happen so that they can be prepared for it. During the meeting if a problem does arise then the team will
  brainstorm on what to do and how to solve the problem. The team is then able to discuss what are the most important parts
  of the project to get done first and which ones need other parts to be completed before the team can move on to the next part.
  One of the ways to help with schedule planning is to not have too many things being processed at the same time. Another way
  is to establish a timeframe on when to have a particular task completed. For instance, I might would say weekly or everyday at
  2:30 pm to have a task completed. As a project manager you should evenly distribute the workload amongst your teammates to make
  sure that they are able to complete the work and not to give them too much work that they cannot handle the work.
</p>
  <p>As a project manager you should set up a to-do list for everyone on the team to be able to see and to make changes regarding
    what part of the process they have done and when it is to be completed. If everyone is allowed to see the list, then it prevents
    others from doing the same job over again, which ends up saving time. There are different tools that you can use to help with
    letting your team members know what the status with project is. As a personal experience I have used a calendar to help to keep
    me on task and I have shared it with others so that they could know what I was doing and when. I was able to update the calendar
    and show the status of what I was working on and when it was completed. It helped to keep my superiors abreast with the assignment
    and they did not have to call to check on the status because they knew it already. It is good to have a tool that will track the
    time and how long it takes to complete a task such as a task tracker. It is also good to be able to make changes on a cellphone so
    that a team member can make updates while on the go. If a problem comes up and they have to leave to go to a different location where
    there is not a computer available, then they would be able to update the status of a task from a cellphone or a tablet. It makes it
    more convenient for your team members and everyone is able to know the status immediately and the team member does not have to wait
    until they get back to the office to give a status update or have to call to let the project manager know the status.
