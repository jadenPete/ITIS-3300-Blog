<p>The agile framework notoriously has a tight development cycle. There are usually several things due with each sprint. It is the responsibility of the entire agile team to be in constant communication with each other in order to have a clear picture of the goal in the mind. Where can it all go wrong? What is good communication in project management, and what does it look like? This blog post will cover the elements of good communication in detail so that you can leave feeling like you have a good understanding of what good communication is.</p>

<h2>Setting Roles and Goals for the Team</h2>

<p>Notably, a lot of miscommunications can happen at the very start of a project. In order to avoid this, we need to set clear goals and roles for the team members at the very start. Gather the entire team and make sure that everyone knows what the expectation is for the role that they will fulfill throughout the development process. Also, it is critical to make sure that the team understands what the process is for troubleshooting any issues that may arise. The ideas discussed here should be a loose guide to follow, and subject to change as the project changes throughout the agile life cycle.</p>

<h2>Best Practices for Agile Communication</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Share a vision.</strong>When everyone on an agile team shares a common goal and vision, it helps them work together more coherently. Usually, the product owner defines this goal and makes sure that the team can bring it to life. The person with the vision needs to keep things clear and straightforward so that the rest of the team can understand and tag along.</li>
    <li<strong>Schedule daily or weekly meetings. </strong>In agile, face to face meetings are ideal, but it's also a good idea to embrace alternatives when teams are spread out. Daily scrum meetings stand out as one such option. These brief gatherings prove to be quite handy when team members are operating across differing time zones. Quick meetings are a great way to keep everyone in sync and ensure the right amount of communication and information sharing. </li>
    <li><strong>Maintain transparency. </strong>These days, we're witnessing a strong push towards making information more accessible to everyone. This increased transparency is highly favored. In project management, communication flows in and out from multiple directions, and collaborations become intricate to the entire operation, as if the case in agile methodologies. </li>
    <li><strong>Keep teams small. </strong>This one isn't always possible depending on the size of your project. But communication becomes more challenging as teams grow larger and larger. Regular sprint planning sessions and daily stand-ups become harder to maintain as the number of team members grow. This can slow development pace, so it's best to introduce additional team members only when it is absolutely necessary. </li>
    <li><strong>Make use of agile software development tools. </strong>The agile software scene is constantly evolving in advancements and hold significant value across multiple industries. It's absolutely crucial for a team to have easy access to plans, objectives, and performance metrics, as well as the ability to conveniently gain a clear understanding of existing trials and tribulations that the project may face. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Miscommunication. </strong>We touched on this point a bit earlier, but let's talk about it in more detail. Larger teams can become a source of bad information. More communication channels can create roadblocks in the information sharing process. Team members should be cognizant of their peers work and that information being shared is accurate and conducive to the success of the project. </li>
    <li><strong>Poorly organized communication. </strong>The absence of critical documentation can often lead to detrimental consequences for the project. Limited knowledge transfer to key team members can also be bad for the project. Well-written documentation plays a pivotal role in preserving the organizational integrity of the project at hand. Having one source of critical documentation that everyone can access creates a workable solution to this problem. </li>
    <li><strong>Situations change. </strong>This is true of life, and it is especially true of agile projects. Requirements for the project undergo constant updates as it moves through its life cycle. This dynamic nature can make the success of a project more difficult to achieve. This is where agile software management tools can play a key role. The tools enable prioritization of important tasks to be completed, tracking of work progress, and constant progress reporting. Additionally, they provide a roadmap which helps to navigate the ever-changing project landscape. </li>
    <li><strong>Different time-zones and languages. </strong>Numerous communication related challenges emerge as a result of differing languages and time zones. This is why clear ground rules must be established from the outset. Emphasis must be placed on individual accountability and trust must be fostered at the organizational level. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Throughout this blog, we've discussed numerous ways to practice good communication in agile. Notably, rules, roles, and goals must be established from the get-go to ensure that the project makes it in the long run. Always reference the best practice techniques when unsure what to do in a situation that presents communication difficulties. Lastly, always remember the communication challenges that can arise and how to best combat them. Following all these principles will ensure that you will make a great communicator for your next team-oriented project.</p>
