<p>Due to the rigorous nature of Agile project management budget constraints. Project teams must come up with estimations of costs for the resources they will use throughout the project. Things that are considered when estimating the cost of a project include team member skillsets, man hours required, need for special software or equipment, and more. Only with all the relevant information present can an agile team come up with an accurate cost estimation. In this blog post we’ll discuss the process behind cost estimation and delve deeper into the fine details of what goes into it.</p>

<h1>Tips to Consider When Estimating Cost</h1>

<p>When estimating the cost of a project it is important to have it define the project’s scope and vice versa. In this sense the scope and cost can be considered interplayed elements that must be considered as a pair. Either the scope must be brought down to be compliant with the budget or the budget must be increased to be compliant with the project’s scope. The two key types of cost addressed by the estimation process are:</p>

<ol type ="1">
    <li><strong>Direct costs: </strong>Expenses linked to a singular realm, whether it be a departmental division or the project in its entirety, encompass a category known as direct costs. Examples of such direct costs include fixed labor expenses, material procurement, and gathering/maintaining equipment.</li>
    <li><strong>Indirect costs: </strong>refer to expenses borne by the entire organization, including items akin to utility expenses and costs associated with quality management. Examples include office supplies, rent, legal fees, and more.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s also important when estimating costs to do a thorough risk assessment. It’s a good idea to have contingency plans in place in order to reduce risk. For example, if a vendor stops carrying a material you need, you should have a backup ready at a moment’s notice.</p>

<h1>Expert Judgement</h1>

<p>Expertise should be taken into account when it pertains to individuals or collectives possessing specialized knowledge or training in the domains of team coordination, physical resource allocation, and estimation. Drawing upon the wisdom of experts, informed by historical data, offers invaluable perspectives regarding the project environment and insights gained from previous similar undertakings. Furthermore, expert judgment can serve as a valuable tool for deciding whether to merge various estimation techniques and for effectively resolving disparities that may arise between them.</p>

<h1>Analogous Estimating Method</h1>

<p>Analogous cost estimation hinges on leveraging values such as scope, cost, budget, and duration, or metrics of magnitude like size, weight, and intricacy, obtained from a previous project of a similar nature. These serve as the foundational reference points for estimating analogous parameters or measurements for the ongoing project. In the realm of cost estimation, this method rests upon the actual expenditures incurred in previous projects as the foundational framework for approximating the financial requirements of the present undertaking. Its reliability is most pronounced when the antecedent projects are genuinely akin in substance rather than superficially resembling the current one, and when the project team members entrusted with the estimations possess the requisite expertise.</p>

<h1>Parametric Estimating Method</h1>

<p>Parametric estimation entails the utilization of an algorithm or statistical correlation between past data and various factors to compute the quantities of resources required for a specific activity, leveraging both historical information and project-specific parameters. An activity requiring 1000 hours of coding and two years to finish could be chunked down into two people coding each producing 500 hours of code in two years.</p>

<h1>Bottom-up Estimation Method</h1>

<p>In Bottom-up estimating, we start by figuring out how much it will cost for each small task or activity. Then, we add up all these costs to get the total cost for bigger parts of the project. This helps us keep track of expenses more accurately. The accuracy depends on how complicated each small task is. If it's simple, we're more likely to get the cost right.</p>

<h1>Three-Point Estimating Method</h1>

<p>To make cost estimates for individual tasks more accurate, we can take uncertainty and risk into account. We use three estimates to create a range for the cost of an activity:</p>

<ol type ="1">
    <li><strong>Most likely (M): </strong>This is the cost we expect based on a realistic assessment of the effort required and any expected expenses.</li>
    <li><strong>Optimistic (O): </strong>This is the cost based on the best-case scenario for the activity, assuming everything goes exceptionally well.</li>
    <li><strong>Pessimistic (P): </strong>This is the cost based on the worst-case scenario for the activity, considering potential difficulties and setbacks.</li>
</ol>

<p>By considering all three estimates, we can get a better understanding of the potential cost range for the activity, which helps in budgeting and planning for uncertainties.</p>

<h1>Data Analysis Method</h1>

<p>During this process, one of the data analysis techniques employed is alternatives analysis, although it's not the only one. Alternatives analysis helps assess various options to determine which ones should be chosen for executing the project's work. It's a way to find the best solutions while staying within the project's limitations. Rather than setting aside extra money for every possible cost increase, which can lead to overestimating, we allocate funds for handling unexpected but statistically predictable cost increases. These funds are known as contingency reserves.</p>

<h1>Decision-Making Method</h1>

<p>Various decision techniques exist, including unanimity, majority, plurality, points allocation, and dictatorship. In the case of unanimity, it demands unanimous agreement, indicating a shared consensus among all involved parties. Meanwhile, majority and plurality decisions typically rely on voting. For a majority decision, more than half of the participants must agree to it, while plurality involves the option with the most votes, even if it doesn't reach the majority threshold.</p>

<h1>Adapting Estimation Techniques for Agile</h1>

<p>In the Agile context, the primary focus revolves around adaptability, teamwork, and the ability to refine estimates as you gather more insights throughout the project's lifecycle. Agile estimation methods, such as Planning Poker and relative sizing, are pivotal in this approach. Regular refinement sessions foster collaboration among team members, allowing for continuous assessment and adjustment of estimates. Moreover, tracking metrics like velocity becomes paramount to gauge the team's capacity and delivery rate effectively. Agile estimation essentially aims to provide the most accurate predictions possible, given the available information at each stage, while remaining open to revising estimates as the project evolves.</p>
