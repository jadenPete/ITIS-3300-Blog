<h2>Introduction to Project Cost Management</h2>
<p>
	In project management, keeping a project's cost under control is typically one of its hardest requirements. Corporations in the business of developing projects rarely ever fund one project at a time; rather, projects almost always compete with each other on cost, and minimizing and stabilizing projects' cost enables those sponsoring them to take on other profitable projects with confidence that funds will not be wasted and cash reserves not depleted.
</p>

<p>
	Publicly traded companies face this pressure even more. Because their financial records are publicly viewable, their ability to act responsibly in the face of financial adversity enables them to attract new investors and maintain existing ones, driving up the price of their stock, fueling them with cash, and extending their runway.

<p>
	All of this demands a battle-tested strategy for managing cost–a hole that project cost management fills perfectly. Project cost management most often comprises five recurring steps that augment the project lifecycle (<a href="#citation-leonard">Leonard</a>):
	<ol>
		<li>Enumerating resources</li>
		<li>Planning a budget</li>
		<li>Tracking expenses</li>
		<li>Controlling cost</li>
		<li>Reflecting and assembling reports</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>
	In an Agile process, these steps should occur cyclically, and past steps should be revisited as necessary to ensure that unforeseen circumstances are met with ample adaptation. Within this blog article, we'll provide an overview of the niche project cost management software fills, and how well-engineered software can facilitate each step, offering examples and analysis of popular software along the way.
</p>

<h2>What Project Cost Management Software Can Do</h2>
<p>
	Project cost management software can automate many of the numeric and mundane procedures of managing cost, which include each of the five stages of cost management. A practice the software is incredibly adept at is maintaining accurate reports of budget and cost, and analyzing those reports to provide valuable feedback to project managers on how they can better estimate and minimize costs in future projects. Especially in the modern era, project management is rarely conducted without the assistance of software.
</p>

<p>
	According to business.com, a popular index of business-running resources, business leaders should keep an eye out for features relating to seven core capabilities when selecting a project management software package (<a href="#citation-francom">Francom</a>):
	<ul>
		<li>Cost estimation</li>
		<li>Budgeting</li>
		<li>Project performance measuring</li>
		<li>Easy reporting</li>
		<li>User-friendly interface</li>
		<li>Affordability</li>
		<li>Third-party integrations</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	It's especially important that the software democratizes the process of maintaining cost–allowing professionals in every role to report and keep up-to-date on costs without reliance on their project managers.

<h2>Devising a Budget</h2>
<p>
	One of the core functions of project cost management software is to facilitate budget planning–the best-effort estimation of how much each resource will cost. So-called cost estimators serve such a purpose, allowing their users to pull data both internally and externally regarding the cost of labor, other software, etc. (<a href="#citation-schwartz">Schwartz</a>).
</p>

<p>
	Using that data, cost estimators are able to employ one of many cost estimation mechanisms, which, according to ProjectManager, include parametric, bottom-up, and three-point estimation. Parametric estimations involves constructing historical estimations of key costs and extrapolating those to gather a rough estimate for the current project. Bottom-up is similar, but more granular in that nearly every cost is accounted for. Either of these can then be paired with three-point estimation, which requires three estimates, low, medium, and high for each cost. Naturally, the output of a three-point estimation is probabilistic, not absolute, in nature.
</p>

<h2>Tracking Cost</h2>
<p>
	Project cost management software is also capable of recording expenses and generating reports according to those expenses, reducing the error rate associated with manually entering data. Columbus, a reputable consulting company, notes that most project management software enables their users to enter many different types of expenses at the moment they are incurred, increasing cost visibility throughout the company and improving the quality of data supplied to analytics tools (<a href="#citation-nichols">Nichols</a>).
</p>

<p>
	Furthermore, reports such as invoices can be easily and quickly generated, as opposed to relying on expensive accountants to generate one by the end of a pay cycle (or even the end of the project). Often, said reports are more professional looking in nature than they otherwise would have been had they been compiled manually. With all considered, heightened speed and professionalism reduces cost, impresses stakeholders, and bolsters company relationships with outside contractors.

<h2>Controlling Cost</h2>
<p>
	A project cost management software suite ought also be a tool in every project manager's belt because of its powerful cost controlling capabilities. Many software packages enable their users to input KPIs (key performance indicators): high level goals companies adopt to shape and justify their expenditures. By viewing these KPIs alongside the cost data whose collection we described in the previous section, companies can make more accurate judgements about how on-point their initial cost measurements were, and whether adjustments need be made (<a href="#citation-nichols">Nichols</a>).
</p>

<p>
	Once they have identified deficiencies in their overall cost strategy, companies are then able to break down cost into key contributors, from which they can compare high-cost resources with the expected return on investment from those resources. Then, after communicating with stakeholders, companies can decide to drop those initiatives or replace them with more profitable ones.
