<p>Resource management plans can be thought of as a master blueprint for how you will divide up your resources in order to achieve your goals. A good resource management plan is one that perfectly outlines how project resources should be categorized, allocated, supervised, and released. The general framework of a resource management plan should include:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Resources:Creating a comprehensive inventory of all necessary resources, including personnel, machinery, equipment, and essential spaces essential for project completion, will enable more efficient planning and scheduling, enhancing overall project effectiveness.</li>
    <li>Timeframes: Monitoring the required time for each resource will provide a clearer perspective on how each resource integrates into your comprehensive schedule.</li>
    <li>Quantity: It's imperative to have a grasp of the specific resources required at any given point in time, along with their respective quantities, in order to proficiently devise a project schedule.</li>
    <li>Assumptions and Constraints: Recognizing all underlying assumptions is a critical element of the planning phase, encompassing factors such as assumptions about employee availability and work commitments. Constraints, on the other hand, encompass the project's schedule, cost, and scope, exerting a substantial influence on both your plan and the project itself.</li>
    <li>Roles & Responsibilities: To mitigate conflicts within projects, it's essential to illuminate the roles and responsibilities of each team member involved. This entails specifying each member's designated position and the tasks for which they will bear responsibility.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Benefits of a Resource Management Plan</h2>

<p>Having a solid resource plan in place will mitigate unforeseen roadblocks in the future. Having a shortage of a resource can create potentially catastrophic effects for your project. A 2020 survey actually showed that having a resource management plan can help prevent employee burnout. Under-allocation of employees to a large task can certainly put a strain on those workers. If a project fails, a resource management plan is another important metric you can analyze when performing a post-mortem. Good resource management plans foster transparency in the management team and they aid in measuring efficiency.</p>

    <li>Start off by figuring out your resource cap: In agile, you do this by taking your teams working hours and subtracting time off that would be spent on vacations, distractions, and other activities. Remember that people aren't constantly working around the clock and factor this into the calculations. </li>
    <li>Plan sprints with the capacity in mind: Go through each sprint, one by one, and allocate the people needed. Once you've assigned the teams, you can work out the capacity for each sprint. The capacity is the upper limit on how much work can be carried out throughout the duration of the entire sprint. Add the work to the sprint from the backlog, making sure to put the most important work at the top of the hierarchy.</li>
    <li>Plan projects and other activities: Sometimes a project can come to encompass more than just working on sprint. Go ahead and allocate some resources to projects and other activities as outlined in the planning phase.</li>
    <li>Perform periodic checks on resource utilization: Not every resource plan is going to be perfect on the first go, in fact, most of them won't. You need to make sure you are checking your plan for capacity and utilization issues. Debbie from accounting is going to be burned out quickly if she has too much work on her docket going from sprint to sprint. It is the resource planners job to make sure things are operating smoothly to this end. </li>
    <li>Try to predict future resource needs: You need to have the ability to look further down the line in order to make commitments to timeframes, potential projects, and resource allocation. This is where a roadmap of future work can help keep the bigger picture in mind. Third party programs can aid in assisting you to figure out where improvements to capacity and efficiency can be made.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Resource planning software</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Spreadsheets: Can absolutely get the job done if the project size is small enough. Larger projects may want to use more advanced software to help plan everything out. </li>
    <li>Gantt charts: More so used for project planning rather than planning resources. Steer clear of these for resource management plans. </li>
    <li>Dedicated resource planning tools: Tools such as Kelloo are specifically built to support resource planning in Agile and other project management methodologies. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<h2>Resource project management is not to be conflated with project planning, the former of which is specifically for the allocation of resources,  given the context of a project. We went over the benefits of why you should implement a resource plan, how to create the resource plan, and the types of software that can aid you in doing so. If you are already using software to plan your project out, it is worth checking out if they have some sort of plugin or separate partition that allows you to manage your resources as well. I hope that this article shed light on how to develop a resource management plan and how to fit it into an agile context. Thanks for reading.</h2>
